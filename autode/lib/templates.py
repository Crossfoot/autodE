"""
The idea with templating is to avoid needless PES scans when finding TSs for which similar have already been found.

For instance the TS for the addition of CN- to acetone is going to be perturbed only slightly by modifying a methyl
for a CH2F group. There it is more efficient to know the forming Câ€“C bond distance in the previous TS, fix it and run
a constrained optimisation which will hopefully be a good guess of the TS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this file we have the classes which will be saved and then loaded at runtime. The idea being that lib/ gets populated
with TS templates which can be searched through..
